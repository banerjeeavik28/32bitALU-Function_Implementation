# 32bitALU-Function_Implementation
Applied 12 rudimentary functions to a 32-bit ALU processor which takes in two 32-bit input values and applies said functions to them. The functions created are:  Add, Subtract, Increment, Decrement, Move (copies the value of an input to the other input), Bit-wise Shift Left, SIMD Add (essentially Add but on multiple sets of bits at a time), Bitwise AND, Bitwise OR, Bitwise Exclusive OR, Compliment, and 2's Compliment.  Flags are implemented to detect for carry bits, possible overflow, sign changes, and resulting zero values. The program is written in System Verilog but for easier access has been converted to pdf.
